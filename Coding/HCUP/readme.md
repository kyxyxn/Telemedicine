The SEDD are part of the HCUP, sponsored by the AHRQ. The SEDD are a set of databases that capture discharge information on all emergency department visits that do not result in an admission. Information on patients initially seen in the emergency room and then admitted to the hospital is included in the HCUP SID. To enumerate all emergency department visits, SEDD discharges should be combined with SID discharges that originate in the emergency department.

- The SEDD contain the emergency department encounter abstracts from hospital-affiliated emergency departments in participating states, translalted into a uniform format.
- The SEDD contain a core set of clinical and non-clinical information on all visits, regardless of the expected payer, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, or those billed as 'no charge'.
- Some State data include other elements such as the patient's race.

Data elements inclulded in the 2016-2018 SEDD are structured as follows:

- Core file
- Charges file
- AHA Linkage file

The **Core** file is a discharge-level file that contains:
- Core data elements that form the nucleus of the SEDD.
- State-specific data elements intended for limited use.
- The core file is a discharge-level file with one observation per discharge abstract.
